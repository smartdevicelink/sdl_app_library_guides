# Style Guide

## Formatting
* Remember that you can't nest platform tags.

### Whitespace
* Use spaces, not tabs, 4 spaces per indentation.
* Use one space after a period, not two.
* One line between paragraphs, paragraphs and code, or paragraphs and a header (###) following it.
* No extra lines between a header (###) and the paragraph following it.

## Grammar
* In text, use `SDL`, not `sdl` or `Sdl`.
* "An SDL", not "A SDL".

## Code Style
* Nothing here yet.
