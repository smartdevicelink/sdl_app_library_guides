# Style Guide

## Formatting
* Currently you can not nest platform tags as it will break the markdown parser. 

### Whitespace
* When indenting text, code snippets, or lists, use spaces instead of tabs. One indentation equals 4 spaces.
* Use one space after a period, not two.
* One line between paragraphs, paragraphs and code, or paragraphs and a header (###) following it.
* Do not add a newline between a paragraph and its header.

## Grammar
* In text, use `SDL`, not `sdl` or `Sdl`.
* "An SDL", not "A SDL".

## Code Style
* Nothing here yet.
