# Style Guide

## Formatting
* Currently you can not nest platform tags as it will break the markdown parser. 

### Whitespace
* When indenting text, code snippets, or lists, use spaces instead of tabs. One indentation equals 4 spaces.
* Use one space after a period, not two.
* Add one newline between paragraphs, a paragraphs and code snippet, or a paragraph followed by a header (i.e. any line of text starting with a #).
* Do not add a newline between a paragraph and its header.

### Images
* Images of HMI screens should be 700px wide. Images of iOS / Android device screens should be 300px wide.

## Grammar
* When abbreviating "SmartDeviceLink" in text (i.e. not in a code snippet where libraries may abbreviate SDL differently), use _SDL_, not _sdl_ or _Sdl_.
* "An SDL", not "A SDL".

## Code Style
* Nothing here yet.
