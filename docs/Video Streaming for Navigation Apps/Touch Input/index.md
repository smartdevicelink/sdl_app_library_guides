# Touch Input
Navigation applications have support for touch events, including both single and multitouch events. This includes interactions such as panning and pinch. A developer may use the included `SDLTouchManager` class, or yourself by listening to the `SDLDidReceiveTouchEventNotification` notification.

!!! NOTE
You must have a valid and approved `appId` in order to receive touch events.
!!!

### Using SDLTouchManager
`SDLTouchManager` has multiple callbacks that will ease the implementation of touch events. You can register for callbacks through the stream manager:

##### Objective-C
```objc
self.sdlManager.streamManager.touchManager.touchEventDelegate = self
```

##### Swift
```swift
sdlManager.streamManager.touchManager.touchEventDelegate = self
```

!!! IMPORTANT
The view passed from the following callbacks are dependent on using the built-in focusable item manager to send haptic rects. See [supporting haptic input](Video Streaming for Navigation Apps/Supporting Haptic Input) "Automatic Focusable Rects" for more information.
!!!

The following callbacks are provided:

##### Objective-C
```objc
- (void)touchManager:(SDLTouchManager *)manager didReceiveSingleTapForView:(nullable UIView *)view atPoint:(CGPoint)point;
- (void)touchManager:(SDLTouchManager *)manager didReceiveDoubleTapForView:(nullable UIView *)view atPoint:(CGPoint)point;
- (void)touchManager:(SDLTouchManager *)manager panningDidStartInView:(nullable UIView *)view atPoint:(CGPoint)point;
- (void)touchManager:(SDLTouchManager *)manager didReceivePanningFromPoint:(CGPoint)fromPoint toPoint:(CGPoint)toPoint;
- (void)touchManager:(SDLTouchManager *)manager panningDidEndInView:(nullable UIView *)view atPoint:(CGPoint)point;
- (void)touchManager:(SDLTouchManager *)manager panningCanceledAtPoint:(CGPoint)point;
- (void)touchManager:(SDLTouchManager *)manager pinchDidStartInView:(nullable UIView *)view atCenterPoint:(CGPoint)point;
- (void)touchManager:(SDLTouchManager *)manager didReceivePinchAtCenterPoint:(CGPoint)point withScale:(CGFloat)scale;
- (void)touchManager:(SDLTouchManager *)manager didReceivePinchInView:(nullable UIView *)view atCenterPoint:(CGPoint)point withScale:(CGFloat)scale;
- (void)touchManager:(SDLTouchManager *)manager pinchDidEndInView:(nullable UIView *)view atCenterPoint:(CGPoint)point;
- (void)touchManager:(SDLTouchManager *)manager pinchCanceledAtCenterPoint:(CGPoint)point;
```

##### Swift
```swift
func touchManager(_ manager: SDLTouchManager, didReceiveSingleTapFor view: UIView?, at point: CGPoint)
func touchManager(_ manager: SDLTouchManager, didReceiveDoubleTapFor view: UIView?, at point: CGPoint)
func touchManager(_ manager: SDLTouchManager, panningDidStartIn view: UIView?, at point: CGPoint)
func touchManager(_ manager: SDLTouchManager, didReceivePanningFrom fromPoint: CGPoint, to toPoint: CGPoint)
func touchManager(_ manager: SDLTouchManager, panningDidEndIn view: UIView?, at point: CGPoint)
func touchManager(_ manager: SDLTouchManager, panningCanceledAt point: CGPoint)
func touchManager(_ manager: SDLTouchManager, pinchDidStartIn view: UIView?, atCenter point: CGPoint)
func touchManager(_ manager: SDLTouchManager, didReceivePinchAtCenter point: CGPoint, withScale scale: CGFloat)
func touchManager(_ manager: SDLTouchManager, didReceivePinchIn view: UIView?, atCenter point: CGPoint, withScale scale: CGFloat)
func touchManager(_ manager: SDLTouchManager, pinchDidEndIn view: UIView?, atCenter point: CGPoint)
func touchManager(_ manager: SDLTouchManager, pinchCanceledAtCenter point: CGPoint)
```

!!! note
Points that are provided via these callbacks are in the head unit's coordinate space. This is likely to correspond to your own streaming coordinate space. You can retrieve the head unit dimensions from `SDLStreamingMediaManager.screenSize`.

### Implementing onTouchEvent Yourself

If apps want to have access to the raw touch data, the `SDLDidReceiveTouchEventNotification` notification can be evaluated. This callback will be fired for every touch of the user and contains the following data:

##### Type
Touch Type   | What does this mean?
-------------|------------------------------------------------------------
BEGIN        | Sent for the first touch event of a touch.
MOVE         | Sent if the touch moved.
END          | Sent when the touch is lifted.
CANCEL       | Sent when the touch is canceled (for example, if a dialog appeared over the touchable screen while the touch was in progress).

##### Event
Touch Event  | What does this mean?
-------------|----------------------
touchEventId | Unique ID of the touch. Increases for multiple touches (0, 1, 2, ...).
timeStamp    | Timestamp of the head unit time. Can be used to compare time passed between touches.
coord        | X and Y coordinates in the head unit coordinate system. (0, 0) is the top left.

#### Example

##### Objective-C
```objc
[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(touchEventAvailable:) name:SDLDidReceiveTouchEventNotification object:nil];

- (void)touchEventAvailable:(SDLRPCNotificationNotification *)notification {
    if (![notification.notification isKindOfClass:SDLOnTouchEvent.class]) {
      return;
    }
    SDLOnTouchEvent *touchEvent = (SDLOnTouchEvent *)notification.notification;

    // Grab something like type
    SDLTouchType* type = touchEvent.type;
}
```

##### Swift
```swift
// To Register
NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(touchEventAvailable(_:)), name: .SDLDidReceiveTouchEvent, object: nil)

// On Receive
@objc private func touchEventAvailable(_ notification: SDLRPCNotificationNotification) {
    guard let touchEvent = notification.notification as? SDLOnTouchEvent else {
        print("Error retrieving onTouchEvent object")
        return
    }

    // Grab something like type
    let type = touchEvent.type
}
```
