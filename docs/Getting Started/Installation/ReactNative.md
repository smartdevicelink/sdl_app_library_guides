# React Native

## Getting Started
SDL will work in a React Native application. Please follow [this guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) for how to create a new React Native application if you need one.

React Native does support Native Modules, however you will need to follow [this guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-modules-ios) to integrate the the SDL library into your application.

This guide is not meant to walk you though how to make a React Native app but help you integrate SDL into a React Native application. We will leave the rest up to you to figure out.

!!! NOTE
You must make sure you have [Native Modules](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-modules-setup) installed as a dependency in order to use 3rd party APIs in a React Native application
!!!

!!! NOTE
Native API methods are not exposed to Javascript. Follow the guides for examples on how to export the methods you wish to expose to your application.
