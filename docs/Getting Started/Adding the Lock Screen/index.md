# Adding the Lock Screen
The lock screen is a vital part of SmartDeviceLink, as the lock screen prevents the user from using your application while the vehicle is in motion. SDL takes care of the lock screen for you. It still allows you to use your own view controller if you prefer your own look, but still want the recommended logic that SDL provides for free.


@![iOS]
If you would not like to use any of the following code, you may use the `SDLLockScreenConfiguration` class function `disabledConfiguration`, and manage the entire lifecycle of the lock screen yourself. However, it is strongly recommended that you use the provided lock screen manager, even if you use your own view controller.

To see where the `SDLLockScreenConfiguration` is used, refer to the [Integration Basics](Getting Started/Integration Basics) guide.

@![android]
## Configure the Lock Screen Activity

You must declare the `SDLLockScreenActivity` in your manifest. To do so, simply add the following to your app's `AndroidManifest.xml` if you have not already done so:

```xml
<activity android:name="com.smartdevicelink.managers.lockscreen.SDLLockScreenActivity"
                  android:launchMode="singleTop"/>
```

!!! MUST
This manifest entry must be added for the lock screen feature to work.

## Using the Provided Lock Screen
Using the default lock screen is simple. Using the lock screen this way will automatically load an automaker's logo, if available, to show alongside your logo. If it is not, the default lock screen will show your logo alone.

@![iOS]
To do this, instantiate a new `SDLLockScreenConfiguration`:
!@

@![android]
If you have implemented the SdlManager and have defined the SDLLockScreenActivity in your manifest but have not defined any lock screen configuration, you are already have a working default configuration.
!@

@![iOS]
##### Objective-C
```objc
SDLLockScreenConfiguration *lockScreenConfiguration = [SDLLockScreenConfiguration enabledConfiguration];
```

##### Swift
```swift
let lockScreenConfiguration = SDLLockScreenConfiguration.enabled()
```
!@

## Customizing the Default Lock Screen
If you would like to use the provided lock screen but would like to add your own appearance to it, we provide that as well. @![iOS]`SDLLockScreenConfiguration`!@ @![android]`LockScreenConfig`!@ allows you to customize the background color as well as your app's icon. If the app icon is not included, we will use the SDL logo.

@![iOS]

### Custom Background Color
@![iOS]
##### Objective-C
```objc
UIColor *backgroundColor = <# Desired Background Color #>
SDLLockScreenConfiguration *lockScreenConfiguration = [SDLLockScreenConfiguration enabledConfigurationWithAppIcon:<# Retreive App Icon #> backgroundColor:backgroundColor];
```

##### Swift
```swift
let backgroundColor: UIColor = <# Desired Background Color #>
let lockScreenConfiguration = SDLLockScreenConfiguration.enabledConfiguration(withAppIcon: <# Retrieve App Icon #>, backgroundColor: backgroundColor)
```
!@

@![android]
```java
lockScreenConfig.setBackgroundColor(resourceColor); // For example, R.color.black
```
!@

### Custom App Icon
@![iOS]
##### Objective-C
```objc
let appIcon: UIImage = <# Retrieve App Icon #>
SDLLockScreenConfiguration *lockScreenConfiguration = [SDLLockScreenConfiguration enabledConfigurationWithAppIcon:appIcon backgroundColor:<# Desired Background Color #>];
```

##### Swift
```swift
let appIcon: UIImage = <# Retrieve App Icon #>
let lockScreenConfiguration = SDLLockScreenConfiguration.enabledConfiguration(withAppIcon: appIcon, backgroundColor: <# Desired Background Color #>)
```
!@

@![android]
```java
lockScreenConfig.setAppIcon(appIconInt); // For example, R.drawable.lockscreen icon
```
!@

### Showing the OEM Logo
@![iOS]
The default lock screen handles retrieving and setting the OEM logo from head units that support this feature. Currently this feature can not be disabled on the default lock screen.
!@

@![android]
This sets whether or not to show the connected device's logo on the default lock screen. The logo will come from the connected hardware if set by the manufacturer. When using a Custom View, the custom layout will have to handle the logic to display the device logo or not. The default setting is false, but some OEM partners may require it.
In your `LockScreenConfig` object, you can set the boolean of whether or not you want the device logo shown, if available:
```java
lockScreenConfig.showDeviceLogo(true);
```
!@

## Create Your Own Lock Screen
If you would like to use your own lock screen instead of the provided SDL one, but still use the logic we provide, you can use a new initializer within @![iOS]`SDLLockScreenConfiguration`!@ @![android]`LockScreenConfig`!@:

@![iOS]
##### Objective-C
```objc
UIViewController *lockScreenViewController = <# Initialize Your View Controller #>;
SDLLockScreenConfiguration *lockScreenConfiguration = [SDLLockScreenConfiguration enabledConfigurationWithViewController:lockScreenViewController];
```

##### Swift
```swift
let lockScreenViewController = <# Initialize Your View Controller #>
let lockScreenConfiguration = SDLLockScreenConfiguration.enabledConfiguration(with: lockScreenViewController)
```
!@

@![android]
```java
lockScreenConfig.setCustomView(customViewInt);
```
!@

## Disabling the Lock Screen Manager

Please note that a lock screen will be required by most OEMs. You can disable the lock screen manager, but you will then be required to implement your own logic for showing and hiding the lock screen. This is not recommended as the @![iOS]`SDLLockScreenConfiguration` !@ @![android]`LockScreenConfig`!@ adheres to most OEM lock screen requirements. However, if you must create a lock screen manager from scratch, the library's lock screen manager can be disabled via the @![iOS]`SDLLockScreenConfiguration`!@ @![android]`LockScreenConfig`!@ as follows:

@![android]
```java
lockScreenConfig.setEnabled(false);
```
!@

@![iOS]
##### Objective-C
```objc
SDLLockScreenConfiguration *lockScreenConfiguration = [SDLLockScreenConfiguration enabledConfiguration];
lockScreenConfiguration.enableAutomaticLockScreen = NO;
```

```swift
let lockScreenConfiguration = SDLLockScreenConfiguration.enabledConfiguration()
lockScreenConfiguration.enableAutomaticLockScreen = false
```
