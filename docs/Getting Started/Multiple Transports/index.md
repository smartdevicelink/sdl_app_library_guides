# Multiple Transports
As of Protocol version 5.1.0, which is supported from SDL Android 4.7 and SDL Core 5.0, a new feature was introduced called Multiple Transports. This feature allows apps to carry their SDL session over multiple transports. The first transport that the app connects to is referred to as the primary transport, and a later connected transport being a secondary transport. For example, apps can register over bluetooth as a primary transport, then connect over WiFi when necessary (ex. to allow video/audio streaming) as a secondary transport.

## Primary Transports

In SDL Android 4.7 and newer, you can connect and register apps via a multiplexed bluetooth and/or USB connection. On head units that support multiple transports, the primary transport will be used for RPC communication while the secondary will be used for high bandwidth services. Otherwise, the primary transport will be used for all applicable services for that transport type.

### Supporting specific primary transports

Whether your app supports both bluetooth and/or USB connections is determined by what you set as acceptable primary transports. By default, both USB and bluetooth are supported and should be kept unless there is a specific reason otherwise. If you list multiple primary transports and one disconnects, if another included transport is available the app will automatically attempt to connect and register to it.

```java
List<TransportType> multiplexPrimaryTransports = Arrays.asList(TransportType.USB, TransportType.BLUETOOTH);
MultiplexTransportConfig mtc = new MultiplexTransportConfig(this, APP_ID, MultiplexTransportConfig.FLAG_MULTI_SECURITY_OFF);
mtc.setPrimaryTransports(multiplexPrimaryTransports);
```

If you only want to use bluetooth or USB, simply pass in a list with the one you want.


!!! Note
For the best compatibility we suggest supporting both primary transports.

### Requiring High Bandwidth

Certain app types will require a high bandwidth transport to be available, which could be either primary or secondary transports. If this is the case, an app will only be registered if a high bandwidth transport is either connected or available to connect.

If this is the case for your app you can set the `setRequiresHighBandwidth` flag to `true`:

```java
MultiplexTransportConfig mtc = new MultiplexTransportConfig(this, APP_ID, MultiplexTransportConfig.FLAG_MULTI_SECURITY_OFF);

mtc.setRequiresHighBandwidth(true);
```

### High bandwidth app with low bandwidth support

While some app's main integration  requires high bandwidth, it is possible to support a low bandwidth integration for better visibility. As an example, a navigation app might require high bandwidth transport to stream their map view but could provide a low bandwidth integration that displays turn-by-turn directions. Another simple low bandwidth integration could simply be displaying a message that instructs the user to connect USB or WiFi to enable the app. In this case the app should set the requires high bandwidth flag to false, as it is by default.


```java
MultiplexTransportConfig mtc = new MultiplexTransportConfig(this, APP_ID, MultiplexTransportConfig.FLAG_MULTI_SECURITY_OFF);

mtc.setRequiresHighBandwidth(false);
```

## Secondary Transports

Secondary transports are supported as of Protocol Version 5.1.0 , and must be enabled by the module the app is connecting to. In addition to supporting bluetooth and USB, TCP is also a supported as a secondary transport.

Setting secondary transports that your app supports is similar to setting the primary transports:

```java
List<TransportType> multiplexPrimaryTransports = Arrays.asList(TransportType.USB, TransportType.BLUETOOTH);
List<TransportType> multiplexSecondaryTransports = Arrays.asList(TransportType.TCP, TransportType.USB, TransportType.BLUETOOTH);
MultiplexTransportConfig mtc = new MultiplexTransportConfig(this, APP_ID, MultiplexTransportConfig.FLAG_MULTI_SECURITY_OFF);
mtc.setPrimaryTransports(multiplexPrimaryTransports);
mtc.setSecondaryTransports(multiplexSecondaryTransports);
```

By default, all three transports are set as supported secondary transports. As mentioned above, secondary transports will often be used for high bandwidth services.
