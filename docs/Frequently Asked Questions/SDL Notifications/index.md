## What is SDL? 
SmartDeviceLink (SDL) connects in-vehicle infotainment systems to smartphone apps. SDL allows automakers to provide highly integrated connected experiences and allows users to operate smartphone apps through the in-vehicle infotainment screen and, if equipped, voice recognition system.

## Why do you see SDL notifications?
If you see a notification similar to the one in the screenshot below, that means you are using an app that has an SDL integration that allows it to push content to cars that support SDL. However, if your car doesn’t support SDL, you can simply hide the notification.
