 # Calling a Phone Number
The @![iOS]`SDLDialNumber`!@@![android,javaSE,javaEE]`DialNumber`!@ RPC allows you make a phone call via the user's phone. Regardless of platform (Android or iOS), you must be sure that a device is connected via Bluetooth (even if using USB) for this RPC to work. If the phone is not connected via Bluetooth, you will receive a result of `REJECTED` from Core.

!!! note
@![iOS]`SDLDialNumber`!@@![android,javaSE,javaEE]`DialNumber`!@ is an RPC that is usually restricted by OEMs. As a result, the OEM you are connecting to may limit app functionality if not approved for usage.
!!!

## Checking if Dial Number is Available
@![iOS]`SDLDialNumber`!@@![android,javaSE,javaEE]`DialNumber`!@ is a newer RPC, so there is a possibility that not all head units will support it. To find out if the RPC is supported by the head unit, check the system capability manager's @![iOS]`hmiCapabilities.phoneCall`!@ @![android,javaSE,javaEE]`hmiCapabilities.isPhoneCallAvailable()`!@ property after the manager has been started successfully.

##### Objective-C
```objc
[self.sdlManager.systemCapabilityManager updateCapabilityType:SDLSystemCapabilityTypePhoneCall completionHandler:^(NSError * _Nullable error, SDLSystemCapabilityManager * _Nonnull systemCapabilityManager) {
    BOOL isDialNumberSupported = NO;
    if (error == nil) {
        isDialNumberSupported = systemCapabilityManager.phoneCapability.dialNumberEnabled.boolValue;
    }
    else {
        isDialNumberSupported = systemCapabilityManager.hmiCapabilities.phoneCall.boolValue;
    }

    <#If making phone calls is supported, send the `DialNumber` RPC#>
}];
```

##### Swift
```swift
sdlManager.systemCapabilityManager.updateCapabilityType(.phoneCall) { (error, systemCapabilityManager) in
    var isDialNumberSupported = false
    if error == nil {
        isDialNumberSupported = systemCapabilityManager.phoneCapability?.dialNumberEnabled?.boolValue ?? false;
    } else {
        isDialNumberSupported = systemCapabilityManager.hmiCapabilities?.phoneCall?.boolValue ?? false
    }

    <#If making phone calls is supported, send the `DialNumber` RPC#>
}
```

@![android,javaSE,javaEE]
```java
HMICapabilities hmiCapabilities = (HMICapabilities)sdlManager.getSystemCapabilityManager().getCapability(SystemCapabilityType.HMI);
if (hmiCapabilities.isPhoneCallAvailable()) {
    // DialNumber supported
} else {
    // DialNumber is not supported
}

## Sending a DialNumber Request
!!! note
`DialNumber` strips all characters except for `0`-`9`, `*`, `#`, `,`, `;`, and `+`.

##### Objective-C
```objc

### DialNumber Result
`DialNumber` has 3 possible results that you should expect:

1. SUCCESS - DialNumber was successfully sent, and a phone call was initiated by the user.
2. REJECTED - DialNumber was sent, and a phone call was cancelled by the user. Also, this could mean that there is no phone connected via Bluetooth.
3. DISALLOWED - Your app does not have permission to use DialNumber.
