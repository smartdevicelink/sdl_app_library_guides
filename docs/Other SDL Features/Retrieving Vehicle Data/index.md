# Retrieving Vehicle Data
You can use the @![iOS]`SDLGetVehicleData` and `SDLSubscribeVehicleData`!@@![android, javase, javaee]`GetVehicleData` and `SubscribeVehicleData`!@ RPC requests to get vehicle data. Each vehicle manufacturer decides which data it will expose and to whom they will expose it. Please check the response from Core to find out which data you will have permission to access. Additionally, be aware that the user may have the ability to disable vehicle data access through the settings menu of their head unit. It may be possible to access vehicle data when the `hmiLevel` is `NONE` (i.e. the user has not opened your SDL app) but you will have to request this permission from the vehicle manufacturer.

!!! NOTE
You will only have access to vehicle data that is allowed to your `appName` and `appId` combination. Permissions will be granted by each OEM separately. See [Understanding Permissions](Getting Started/Understanding Permissions) for more details.

## One-Time Vehicle Data Retrieval
To get vehicle data a single time, use the @![iOS]`SDLGetVehicleData`!@@![android, javaSE, javaEE]`GetVehicleData`!@ RPC.

@![iOS]
##### Objective-C
```objc
SDLGetVehicleData *getGPSData = [[SDLGetVehicleData alloc] init];
getGPSData.gps = @YES;
[self.sdlManager sendRequest:getGPSData withResponseHandler:^(__kindof SDLRPCRequest * _Nullable request, __kindof SDLRPCResponse * _Nullable response, NSError * _Nullable error) {
    SDLGetVehicleDataResponse *vehicleDataResponse = (SDLGetVehicleDataResponse *)response;
    SDLResult resultCode = vehicleDataResponse.resultCode;

    if (![resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultSuccess]) {
        if ([resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultDisallowed]) {
            <#The app does not have permission to access this vehicle data#>
        } else if ([resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultRejected]) {
            <#The app does not have permission to access this vehicle data because of the app state (i.e. app is closed or in background)#>
        } else if ([resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultVehicleDataNotAllowed]) {
            <#The data is not available or responding on the system#>
        } else if ([resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultVehicleDataNotAvailable]) {
            <#The user has turned off access to vehicle data, and it is globally unavailable to mobile applications#>
        } else {
            <#Some other error occurred#>
        }
        return;
    }

    SDLGPSData *gpsData = vehicleDataResponse.gps;
    if (gpsData == nil) { return; }
    <#Use the GPS data#>
}];
```

##### Swift
```swift
let getGPSData = SDLGetVehicleData()
getGPSData.gps = true as NSNumber
sdlManager.send(request: getGPSData) { (request, response, error) in
    guard let response = response as? SDLGetVehicleDataResponse else { return }
    guard response.resultCode == .success else {
        switch response.resultCode {
        case .disallowed:
            <#The app does not have permission to access this vehicle data#>
        case .rejected:

        case .vehicleDataNotAvailable:
            <#The user has turned off access to vehicle data, and it is globally unavailable to mobile applications#>
        default:
            <#Some other error occurred#>
        }
        return
    }

    guard let gpsData = response.gps else { return }

## Subscribing to Vehicle Data
Subscribing to vehicle data allows you to get notifications whenever new data is available. You should not rely upon getting this data in a consistent manner. New vehicle data is available roughly every second, but this is totally dependent on which head unit you are connected to.

@![iOS]
**First**, register to observe the `SDLDidReceiveVehicleDataNotification` notification:

##### Objective-C
```objc
// sdl_ios v6.3+
[self.sdlManager subscribeToRPC:SDLDidReceiveVehicleDataNotification withObserver:self selector:@selector(vehicleDataAvailable:)];

// Pre sdl_ios v6.3
[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(vehicleDataAvailable:) name:SDLDidReceiveVehicleDataNotification object:nil];
```

##### Swift
```swift
// sdl_ios v6.3+
sdlManager.subscribe(to: .SDLDidReceiveVehicleData, observer: self, selector: #selector(vehicleDataAvailable(_:)))

// Pre sdl_ios v6.3
NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(vehicleDataAvailable(_:)), name: .SDLDidReceiveVehicleData, object: nil)
```

**Second**, send the `SubscribeVehicleData` request:

##### Objective-C
```objc
SDLSubscribeVehicleData *subscribeGPSData = [[SDLSubscribeVehicleData alloc] init];
subscribeGPSData.gps = @YES;

[self.sdlManager sendRequest:subscribeGPSData withResponseHandler:^(__kindof SDLRPCRequest * _Nullable request, __kindof SDLRPCResponse * _Nullable response, NSError * _Nullable error) {
    SDLSubscribeVehicleDataResponse *vehicleDataResponse = (SDLSubscribeVehicleDataResponse *)response;
    if (![vehicleDataResponse.resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultSuccess]) {
        if ([vehicleDataResponse.resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultDisallowed]) {
            <#The app does not have permission to access this vehicle data#>
        } else if ([vehicleDataResponse.resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultUserDisallowed]) {
            <#The user has not granted access to this type of vehicle data item at this time#>
        } else if ([vehicleDataResponse.resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultIgnored]) {
            SDLVehicleDataResult *gpsData = vehicleDataResponse.gps;
            if ([gpsData.resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLVehicleDataResultCodeDataAlreadySubscribed]) {
                <#Ignoring request because the app is already subscribed to GPS data#>
            } else if ([gpsData.resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLVehicleDataResultCodeVehicleDataNotAvailable]) {
                <#The app has permission to access to the GPS data, but the vehicle does not provide it#>
            } else {
                <#Request ignored for some other reason#>
            }
        } else {
            <#Some other error occurred#>
        }
        return;
    }

     <#Successfully subscribed to GPS data#>
 }];
```

##### Swift
```swift
let subscribeGPSData = SDLSubscribeVehicleData()
subscribeGPSData.gps = true as NSNumber

sdlManager.send(request: subscribeGPSData) { (request, response, error) in
    guard let response = response as? SDLSubscribeVehicleDataResponse else { return }
    guard response.resultCode == .success else {
        switch response.resultCode {
        case .disallowed:
            <#The app does not have permission to access this vehicle data#>
        case .userDisallowed:
            <#The user has not granted access to this type of vehicle data item at this time#>
        case .ignored:
            guard let gpsData = response.gps else { break }
            switch gpsData.resultCode {
            case .dataAlreadySubscribed:
                <#Ignoring request because the app is already subscribed to GPS data#>
            case .vehicleDataNotAvailable:
                <#The app has permission to access to the GPS data, but the vehicle does not provide it#>
            default:
                <#Request ignored for some other reason#>
            }
        default:
            <#Some other error occurred#>
        }
        return
    }

    <#Successfully subscribed to GPS data#>
}
```

**Third**, react to the notification when new vehicle data is received:

##### Objective-C
``` objc
- (void)vehicleDataAvailable:(SDLRPCNotificationNotification *)notification {
    SDLOnVehicleData *onVehicleData = (SDLOnVehicleData *)notification.notification;
    SDLGPSData *gps = onVehicleData.gps;
    if (gps == nil) { return; }
    <#Use the GPS data#>
}
```

##### Swift
```swift
func vehicleDataAvailable(_ notification: SDLRPCNotificationNotification) {
    guard let onVehicleData = notification.notification as? SDLOnVehicleData, let gpsData = onVehicleData.gps else {
        return
    }
    <#Use the GPS data#>
}
```
!@

@![android, javaSE, javaEE]
**First**, you should add a notification listener for the `OnVehicleData` notification:

```java
sdlManager.addOnRPCNotificationListener(FunctionID.ON_VEHICLE_DATA, new OnRPCNotificationListener() {
    @Override
    public void onNotified(RPCNotification notification) {
        OnVehicleData onVehicleDataNotification = (OnVehicleData) notification;
        if (onVehicleDataNotification.getPrndl() != null) {
            Log.i("SdlService", "PRNDL status was updated to: " + onVehicleDataNotification.getPrndl());
        }
    }
});
```

**Second**, send the `SubscribeVehicleData` request:

```java
SubscribeVehicleData subscribeRequest = new SubscribeVehicleData();
subscribeRequest.setPrndl(true);
subscribeRequest.setOnRPCResponseListener(new OnRPCResponseListener() {
    @Override
    public void onResponse(int correlationId, RPCResponse response) {
        if(response.getSuccess()){
            Log.i("SdlService", "Successfully subscribed to vehicle data.");
        }else{
            Log.i("SdlService", "Request to subscribe to vehicle data was rejected.");
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(int correlationId, Result resultCode, String info){
        Log.e(TAG, "onError: "+ resultCode+ " | Info: "+ info );
    }
});
sdlManager.sendRPC(subscribeRequest);
```

**Third**, the `onNotified` method will be called when there is an update to the subscribed vehicle data.

## Unsubscribing from Vehicle Data
We suggest that you only subscribe to vehicle data as needed. To stop listening to specific vehicle data use the @![iOS]`SDLUnsubscribeVehicleData`!@@![android, javase, javaee]`UnsubscribeVehicleData`!@ RPC.

@![iOS]
##### Objective-C
```objc
SDLUnsubscribeVehicleData *unsubscribeGPSData = [[SDLUnsubscribeVehicleData alloc] init];
unsubscribeGPSData.gps = @YES;

[self.sdlManager sendRequest:unsubscribeGPSData withResponseHandler:^(__kindof SDLRPCRequest * _Nullable request, __kindof SDLRPCResponse * _Nullable response, NSError * _Nullable error) {
    SDLUnsubscribeVehicleDataResponse *vehicleDataResponse = (SDLUnsubscribeVehicleDataResponse*)response;

    if (![vehicleDataResponse.resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultSuccess]) {
        if ([vehicleDataResponse.resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultDisallowed]) {
            <#The app does not have permission to access this vehicle data#>
        } else if ([vehicleDataResponse.resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultUserDisallowed]) {
            <#The user has not granted access to this type of vehicle data item at this time#>
        } else if ([vehicleDataResponse.resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultIgnored]) {
            SDLVehicleDataResult *gpsData = vehicleDataResponse.gps;
            if ([gpsData.resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLVehicleDataResultCodeDataNotSubscribed]) {
                <#The app has access to this data item but ignoring since the app is already unsubscribed to GPS data#>
            } else {
                <#Request ignored for some other reason#>
            }
        } else {
            <#Some other error occurred#>
        }
        return;
    }

    <#Successfully unsubscribed to GPS data#>
}];
```

##### Swift
```swift
let unsubscribeGPSData = SDLUnsubscribeVehicleData()
unsubscribeGPSData.gps = true as NSNumber

sdlManager.send(request: unsubscribeGPSData) { (request, response, error) in
    guard let response = response as? SDLUnsubscribeVehicleDataResponse else { return }

    guard response.resultCode == .success else {
        switch response.resultCode {
        case .disallowed:
            <#The app does not have permission to access this vehicle data#>
        case .userDisallowed:
            <#The user has not granted access to this type of vehicle data item at this time#>
        case .ignored:
            guard let gpsData = response.gps else { break }
            switch gpsData.resultCode {
            case .dataNotSubscribed:
                <#The app has access to this data item but ignoring since the app is already unsubscribed to GPS data#>
            default:
                <#Request ignored for some other reason#>
            }
        default:
            <#Some other error occurred#>
        }
        return
    }

    <#Successfully unsubscribed to GPS data#>
}
```

## OEM-Specific Vehicle Data
OEM applications can access additional vehicle data published by their systems that is not available via the SDL vehicle data APIs. This data is accessed using the same SDL vehicle data RPCs, but instead of requesting a certain type of SDL-specified data,  you must request data using a custom vehicle data name. The type of object returned is up to the OEM and must be parsed manually.

!!! NOTE
This feature is only for OEM-created applications and is not permitted for 3rd-party use.
!!!

### Requesting One-Time OEM-Specific Vehicle Data
Below is an example of requesting a custom piece of vehicle data with the name `OEM-X-Vehicle-Data`. To adapt this for subscriptions instead, you must look at the section **Subscribing to Vehicle Data** above and adapt the example for subscribing to custom vehicle data based on what you see in the examples below.

@![iOS]
##### Objective-C
```objc
SDLGetVehicleData *getCustomData = [[SDLGetVehicleData alloc] init];
[getCustomData setOEMCustomVehicleData:@"OEM-X-Vehicle-Data" withVehicleDataState:YES];
[self.sdlManager sendRequest:getCustomData withResponseHandler:^(__kindof SDLRPCRequest * _Nullable request, __kindof SDLRPCResponse * _Nullable response, NSError * _Nullable error) {
    SDLGetVehicleDataResponse *vehicleDataResponse = (SDLGetVehicleDataResponse *)response;
    SDLResult resultCode = vehicleDataResponse.resultCode;

    if (![resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultSuccess]) {
        if ([resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultDisallowed]) {
            <#The app does not have permission to access this vehicle data#>
        } else if ([resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultRejected]) {
            <#The app does not have permission to access this vehicle data because of the app state (i.e. app is closed or in background)#>
        } else if ([resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultVehicleDataNotAllowed]) {
            <#The data is not available or responding on the system#>
        } else if ([resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultVehicleDataNotAvailable]) {
            <#The user has turned off access to vehicle data, and it is globally unavailable to mobile applications#>
        } else {
            <#Some other error occurred#>
        }
        return;
    }

    <#OEMCustomVehicleDataType#> *customVehicleData = [vehicleDataResponse getOEMCustomVehicleData:@"OEM-X-Vehicle-Data"];
    if (customVehicleData == nil) { return; }
    <#Use the custom data#>
}];
```

##### Swift
```swift
let getCustomData = SDLGetVehicleData()
getCustomData.setOEMCustom("OEM-X-Vehicle-Data", withVehicleDataState: true)
sdlManager.send(request: getCustomData) { (request, response, error) in
